# Data-Driven Influenza Analysis & Workforce Planning

## Project Overview
This project analyzes public health and demographic data (CDC, US Census) to identify factors influencing healthcare system pressure during the influenza season and to support data-driven workforce planning.

## Business Questions
- Which regions show increased healthcare pressure during flu season?
- How do age structure, seasonal doctor visits, and vaccination rates affect influenza-related risks?
- How can regions be prioritized for temporary workforce deployment?

## Data Sources
- CDC Influenza and Mortality Data
- US Census Demographic Data

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and validation
- Data integration across multiple sources
- Development of standardized KPIs (per 100,000 population)
- Construction of a weighted composite index for regional prioritization

## Key Insights
- Regions with a higher share of population aged 65+ show significantly higher healthcare pressure.
- Seasonal peaks in doctor visits correlate with increased influenza mortality.
- Lower vaccination rates contribute to higher regional risk levels.

## Recommendations
- Early workforce planning for high-risk regions before flu season peaks
- Targeted vaccination campaigns in regions with low vaccination coverage

## Tools
Excel, Tableau

## Output
- Interactive Tableau Story (see link below)
